    <h2> HTML - Foundation of the Web</h2><br>

    <p>Posted by <b>FLORENCE NACORDA</b></p><br>
        
        <p><b>HTML</b>, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, <br>
                     so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.</p><br>
                   
        <p>HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript
           to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.</p><br>

        <p>In this case, I like to break down the three technologies <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>, and <b>JavaScript</b> this way: they are like a human body.</p><br>
        
        <ul>
            <li>HTML is the skeleton,</li>
            <li>CSS is the skin</li>
            <li>and JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that brings the structure and the skin to life.</li>
        </ul><br>
    
        <p>You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house,CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, <br>
                and many other functional features that make the house livable.</p><br>

        <b>HTML Tags</b><br>
            <p>Since HTML defines the markup for a particular web page, you'll want the text, images, or other embeds to appear in certain ways.</p><br>
            <p>For example, you might want some text to be big, other text to be small, and some to be bold, italic, or in bullet point form.</p><br>
            <p><b>HTML</b> has "tags" that let you get this done. So, there are tags to create headings, paragraphs, bolded words, italicized words, and more.</p><br>
            <p>The image below describes the anatomy of an HTML tag:</p>
            <img src="anatomy-of-an-html-tag.png" height="400" width=600" alt=html"><br><br>

        <b>HTML Elements</b>
        <br>
            <p>An element consists of the opening tag, a character, the content, and a closing tag. Some elements are empty<br>
            that is, they don't have a closing tag but instead have a source or link to content that you want to embed on the web page.</p><br>
            <p>An example of an empty element is <em><img></em>, which you use to embed images on a web page.</p><br>
            <p>HTML elements are often used interchangeably with tags, but there's a small difference between the two. <br>
             An element is a combination of the opening and closing tag, and then the content between them.</p><br>
            <p>I made another image to help you visualize the anatomy of an HTML element:</p><br>
        
            <img src="anatomy-of-an-html-element.png" height="400" width="600" alt="html element">
         <br>
         <br>
         <b>HTML Attributes</b>
            <p>HTML tags also take what are called attributes. These attributes are placed in the opening tag and range from style and ids to classes. <br>
            They take values, which convey more information about the element and help you do things such as styling and manipulation with JavaScript.</p><br>
            <p>In the infographic below, the opening tag contains a class attribute with a value of “text”. This can be used to style the element or select it with JavaScript for interactivity.</p><br>
            <img src="attribute-1.png"  height="400" width="600" alt="html attribute"><br>

        <p><b>Why you should learn HTML?</b></p></br>
            <p>Learning HTML is very important for several reasons:</p>
                 <ul>
                    <li>Foundation of Web development</li>
                    <li>Fundamental skill of a web developer</li>
                    <li>Create and customize content on the web</li>
                    <li>Career opportunities</li>
                    <li>Business Solutions</li>
                 </ul></br>
            
        <p>By doing a lot of practice, you will definitely experience a lot of errors and bugs in your code. But don't worry, you will overcome them all!</p>
